### Background and the Data

Cooking can be fun but challenging. Finding the right recipe is not always easy.<br> Especially when considering the health factors and timing of the year. My analysis will give insight as to what others are making and the trends in nutritional qualities.<br>

My data is made up of recipes scraped from Epicurious.com. I used BeautifulSoup to extract the features that I needed from each page. Each recipe came with on average 50 different features.

###Goal

To find out the difference in Fat content in the recipes tagged with 'Winter' and 'Summer'. Perhaps people are eating healthier during the summertime to try to lose weight. I will be surprised with these findings because I love fatty foods at all times of the year.

###Data and Cleaning

The data that I scraped has about 33,000 rows
I had to sort the data based on the tags that each row was returning.
For this project I was primarily focused on the numerical data of the nutrition columns and the Tag data. Columns with ingredient info was included as well.<br>
